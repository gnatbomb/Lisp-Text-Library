This program creates several functions in LISP.
There are six major functions I created for this:
  -issorted(L): returns whether or not the list L is sorted in ascending order.
  -numbers(N): returns a list containing all integers from 1 to N in ascending order.
  -palindrome(L): returns whether or not list L is a palindrome.
  -replace2(A B L): replaces all instances of atom A in L with atom B.
  -common(A B): returns how many atoms A and B have in common. Only works on lists where atoms do not repeat.
  -setcover(U S): given a set U and list of sets S, returns the smallest subset of S which spans U.
